## What is Fuchsia?
Fuchsia is a modular, capability-based operating system. Fuchsia runs on modern 64-bit Intel and ARM processors.
It is created by Google and completely [open source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com). Currently it has not been officially announced by Google but it is expected to be revealed at the [IO 2019](https://events.google.com/io/).

## Zircon (microkernel)
Zircon is the core platform that powers the Fuchsia OS. Zircon is composed of a microkernel as well as a small set of userspace services, drivers, and libraries necessary for the system to boot, talk to hardware, load userspace processes and run them, etc.

- [Quick Start Recipes](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/zircon/docs/getting_started.md) - Build Zircon on your machine

- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/refs/heads/master/system/) - Zircon source code

## Garnet 
Garnet is the first Fuchsia layer above the kernel. It contains a variety of low-level things that every OS needs including device drivers (network, graphics, etc) and software installation. The Garnet UI services are called `Mozart`.

### Scenic (graphics engine)
Scenic is a Garnet service that composes graphical objects from multiple processes into a shared scene graph. The objects can cast shadows or reflect light onto each other, even if the originating processes have no knowledge of each other.
- [Introduction](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/refs/heads/master/docs/ui/scenic.md) - Explains concepts of Scenic including `Nodes`, `Scenes` and `Compositors`
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/refs/heads/master/lib/ui/scenic/) - Scenic source code

#### Gfx
Gfx owns the scene graph and is responsible for rendering.
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/refs/heads/master/lib/ui/gfx/) - Gfx source code

#### Input
Input is responsible for routing input events to clients, which also involves coordinating gesture recognition across clients

[Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/refs/heads/master/lib/ui/input/) - Input source code

#### Escher
Escher is a Vulkan-based rendering library used by the *Gfx* system
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master/public/lib/escher/) - Escher source code

### Amber (updater)
Amber is an update system with the ambition of updating all components running on a Fuchsia system whether that component is a kernel, a bootloader, a system service, an application, etc.
- [Introduction](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/refs/heads/master/go/src/amber/README.md) - Short introduction to Amber

## Peridot
Peridot provides the services needed to create a cohesive, customizable, multi-device user experience assembled from modules, stories, agents, entities, and other components.

### Modular
Modular is the application framework for Fuchsia. It manages user experiences by composing UI, data, and users from a diverse set of components into logical and visual containers called Stories.

- [Simple Example](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/peridot/+/refs/heads/master/examples/simple/) - Simple Fuchsia program (C++) using the modular framework

### Ledger (cloud sync)
Ledger is a distributed storage system for Fuchsia.
Each application running on behalf of a particular user has a separate data store managed by Ledger. It is transparently synchronized across devices of its user by cloud providers.  
The goal of ledger is that the user does not notice it while it

## Topaz
Topaz contains four major categories of software: modules, agents, shells, and runners.  
For example, modules include the calendar, email, and terminal modules, shells include the base shell and the user shell, agents include the email and chat content providers, and runners include the Web, Dart, and Flutter runners.
